# ClassTranscribeExporter

ClassTranscribeExporter exports the contents of a course.
The course video files and transcriptions can be downloaded.
The exporter can build an mrss xml bulk-upload file to allow upload of the course contents into other systems (e.g. MediaSpace)

Regular expression filter options exclude playlist or video.
By default all transcription languages are referenced in the bulk upload file.

No long-term support is promised or specified: Future changes to the ClassTranscribe json api may impact the functioning of this code.
